            <b>A drug is any chemical substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology <br>
                when consumed. Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional 
                support. Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via
                 a patch on the skin, suppository, or dissolution under the tongue.<br>
              
                 <br>

                In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered<br>
                 to a living organism, produces a biological effect. A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or
                  medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote 
                  well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more 
                  recently also by organic synthesis. Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a 
                  regular basis for chronic disorders.<br>
                
<br>

                Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classesâ€”groups of related drugs that have similar <br>
                chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), a related
                 mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
                 Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique 
                 ATC code, which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC 
                 system. Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. This 
                 classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties.<br>
                
<br>

                Psychoactive drugs are substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering <br>
                perception, mood or consciousness. These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, 
                depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. These psychoactive 
                drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental 
                disorders around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, nicotine 
                and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather 
                than medicinal purposes. All drugs can have potential side effects. Abuse of several psychoactive 
                drugs can cause addiction and/or physical dependence. Excessive use of stimulants can promote 
                stimulant psychosis. Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the 
                Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.</b><br>
